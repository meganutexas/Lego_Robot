// Write a Quorum program that is a mad libs. You should have variables like noun, 
// adjetive etc, maybe even multiple of each (noun1, noun2). Have a story output that
// periodically includes one of your text variables that is a part of speech.
// In a later lesson we will update this program to ask the user what words they want
// to use.
// example of a simple mad lib: 
// text noun = "penguin"
// output "my favorite animal is a " + noun

output "Mad Libs"
