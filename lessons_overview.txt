Each Lesson Folder will have the following items:
1. A lessonWhatever.txt file with instructions for the lesson as well as any tutorial
type information the students will need for the lesson.
2. An examples directory that holds example code for the lesson.
3. An practice directory that holds exercises for the students to do for each lesson

The examples and practice directories also have a run.sh script inside of them. This script
is used to compile and run the .quorum files the students will be writing. The script was written so that it
would not be necessary to have the Quorum.jar file and Library directory in multiple places as this
would make the repo extremely big. An explanation on how to use the run.sh script can be found
in lesson1.txt.
